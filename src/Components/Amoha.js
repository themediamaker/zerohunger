Artists can donate their creations to AMOHA’s gallery, knowing that their art will not only be displayed in a space dedicated to celebrating global heritage and culture but also directly contribute to eradicating hunger. These donated pieces will be put up for sale, and the funds raised will be channeled into Mission Zero Hunger.

                Another way for artists to participate in the noble cause is to join our AMOHA Art Residency Retreats in Rajasthan, India. The retreats are at our stunning Heritage Resort, the Six Senses Fort Barwara, a royal retreat in an ancient 14th-century fort hotel next to the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve. The artist needs to give us a painting or sculpture equivalent to their stay cost. We will be selling these works to fund our Mission Zero Hunger.
