              Our target of providing 3 billion meals each day highlights the magnitude of our commitment to tackling hunger. The current global population is approximately 8 billion people, and a significant portion of this population faces food insecurity. By focusing on delivering 3 billion meals a day, Mission Zero Hunger aims to ensure that a substantial percentage of this need is met, providing immediate relief and laying the foundation for long-term food security.
